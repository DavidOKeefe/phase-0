## Chrome Dev Tools Reflection

Q: How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
A: Using Chrome's DevTools seemed like a fast and easy way to try out different CSS options. The immediate feedback made a trial and error approach much more feasible.

Q: How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
A:You can resize elements by changing the width and height CSS properties.

Q: What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
A: Absolute takes the element out of the normal flow so it's not affected by other elements on the page. Fixed is a type of absolute positioning that positions the element relative to the browser window. Static is the default positioning and will cause each element to sit on top of the next one. Relative moves an element a defined amount relative to where it would have been using in the normal flow.

Q: What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?
A: Padding is space around the content. Border is distance beyond the padding and margin is distance beyond the border.

Q: What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
A: I found it to be helpful to get me using developer tools. I've been looking at the HTML of other websites using the tools but I didn't appreciate how much it could be used while creating my own sites.
